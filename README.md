### Overview

In this assignment, you'll build a professional portfolio site using HTML/CSS. These instructions include a short style guide; follow it to design an aesthetically pleasing layout while creating different kinds of complex HTML elements.

* This exercise will challenge most students unfamiliar with HTML/CSS.

### Instructions

Navigate to the `Basic-Portfolio` folder that you just cloned onto your machine. Inside this folder, create the following:

   * 3 HTML documents: `index.html`, `contact.html` and `portfolio.html`.
   * A folder called `assets`.
   * Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: `css` and `images`.
     * In the `css` folder, make a file called `style.css`.
     * In the `images` folder, save the images you plan on using (like your profile image and the placeholder images for the portfolio).
